# Thermal Imaging Object Detection Using YOLOv5

## Object Detection
Object detection is a computer technology related to computer vision and image processing that deals with detecting instances of semantic objects of a certain class in digital images and videos. Well-researched domains of object detection include face detection and pedestrian detection.

## Thermal Images
Infrared thermography, thermal video and/or thermal imaging, is a process where a thermal camera captures and creates an image of an object by using infrared radiation emitted from the object in a process, which are examples of infrared imaging science.

## Yolov5
YOLO an acronym for 'You only look once', is an object detection algorithm that divides images into a grid system. Each cell in the grid is responsible for detecting objects within itself.
It was found that YOLOv5 outperforms YOLOv4 and YOLOv3 in terms of accuracy. The detection speed of YOLOv3 was faster compared to YOLOv4 and YOLOv5 and the detection speed of YOLOv4 and YOLOv5 were identical.
